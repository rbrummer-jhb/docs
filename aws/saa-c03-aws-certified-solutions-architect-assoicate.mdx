## Availability Zones and Regions

### AWS Global Infrastructure

![AWS Global Infrastructure](../images/aws-global-infrastructure.png)

### Availability Zones

Think of an Availability Zone as a **Data Center**.

### Data Centers

A data center is just a building filled with **servers**.

An Availability Zone may be several data centers, but because they are close together, they are counted as **1 Availability Zone**.

### Regions

A geographical area. Each Region consists of **2 (or more) Availability Zones**.

<Note>
  **Upate:** AWS now defines Regions as **3 or more Availability Zones**.
</Note>

### Edge Locations

Endpoints for AWS that are used for caching content.

- Typically, this consists of **CloudFront**, Amazon's Content Delivery Network (CDN).
- There are **many more edge locations** that Regions.
- Currently, there are **over 215 edge locations**.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
**A Region** is a physical location in the world that consists of 2 or more Availability Zones (AZs).

**An AZ** is 1 or more discrete data centers - each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity - housed in separate facilities.

**Edge Locations** are endpoints for AWS that are used for caching content.

</Note>

## Shared Responsibility Model

### Renting Resources in the Cloud

Who's responsible for what?

| You              | Rental Company   |
| :--------------- | :--------------- |
| Not to damage it | Tire pressure    |
| Not to speed     | Full tank of gas |
| Pay tolls, etc   | Mechanics        |

### The Model

| Customer: Responsiblity for Security IN the Cloud            | AWS: Responsibility for Security OF the Cloud |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Customer Data                                                | Software                                      |
| Platform, Applications, Identitiy & Access Management        | Compute, Storage, Database, Networking        |
| Operating System, Network & Firewall Configuration           | Hardware/AWS Global Infrastructure            |
| Client-Side Data Encryption & Data Integrity Authentication  | Regions                                       |
| Server-Side Encryption (File System and/or Data)             | Availability Zones                            |
| Network Traffic Protection (Encryption, Integrity, Identity) | Edge Locations                                |

### Exam Tips

<Note>
**Can you do this yourself in the AWS Managemenet Console?**

**If yes, you are likely responsible.** Security groups, IAM users, patching EC2 operating systems, patching databases running on EC2, etc.

**If not, AWS is likely responsible.** Management of data centers, security cameras, cabling, patching RDS operating systems, etc.

**Encryption is a shared responsiblity.**

</Note>

## Compute, Storage, Databases, and Networking

### Compute

You wouldn't be able to build an application without compute power - you need something crunching the data.

- EC2
- Lambda
- Elastic Beanstalk

### Storage

Like a giant disk in the cloud - it's a safe place to save your information.

- S3
- EBS
- EFS
- FSx
- Storage Gateway

### Databases

Like a spreadsheet - a reliable way to store and retrieve information.

- RDS
- DynamoDB
- Redshift

### Networking

A way for compute, storage, and databases to communicate and to live.

- VPCs
- Direct Connect
- Route 53
- API Gateway
- AWS Global Accelerator

### Exam Tips

<Note>
**Compute:** EC2, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk.

**Storage:** S3, EBS, EFS, FSx, Storage Gateway.

**Databases:** RDS, DynamoDB, Redshift.

**Networking:** VPCs, Direct Connect, Route 53, API Gateway, AWS Global Accelerator.

</Note>

## The Well-Architected Framework

### AWS Whitepapers

AWS has hundreds of whitepapers available - `https://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers`.

### The 6 Pillars

**Operational Excellence**

Running and monitoring systems to deliver business value, and continually improving processes and procedures.

**Performance Efficiency**

Using IT computing resources efficiently.

**Security**

Protecting information and systems.

**Cost Optimization**

Avoiding unnecessary costs.

**Reliability**

Ensuring a workload performs its intended function correctly and consistently when it's expected.

**Sustainability**

Minimizing the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads.

### Exam Tips

<Note>**Read the Whitepaper.**</Note>

## Quiz: Availability Zones and Regions

<Note>
**Which statement best describes an Availability Zone?**

One or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region.

**Why is security one of the pillars of the Well-Architected Framework?**

Because security is the highest priority at AWS; if you don't have a securely built application, your customers won't trust you with their data.

**Which of the following is NOT an AWS storage service?**

EC2

**Which one of the following items are NOT managed by AWS according to the shared responsibility model?**

Customer data.

**What category would the VPC service fall into?**

Networking.

# Chapter 3 - Identity and Access Management

- [Securing the Root Account](#securing-the-root-account)
- [IAM Policy Documents](#iam-policy-documents)
- [Permanent IAM Credentials](#permanent-iam-credentials)
- [Quiz: Identity and Access Management](#quiz-identity-and-access-management)

## Securing the Root Account

### What is IAM

Allows you to manage users and their level of access to the AWS console.

- Create users and grant permissions to them.
- Create groups and roles.
- Control access to AWS resources.

### What is the Root Account

The `root account` is the email address you used to sign up for AWS. It has full administrative access to AWS. It is important to secure this account.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
Enable multi-factor authentication on the root account.

Create an admin group for your administrators, and assign the appropriate permissions to this group.

Create user accounts for your administrators.

Add your users to the admin group.

</Note>

## IAM Policy Documents

### Permissions with IAM

We assign permissions using policy documents, which are made up of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

### JSON Example of Policy Documents

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Permanent IAM Credentials

### The Building Blocks of IAM

- **Users** - a physical person.
- **Groups** - Functions, such as administrator, developer, etc. Contains users.
- **Roles** - Internal usage within AWS.

### Best Practices: Policies

<Tip>It's best practice for users to **inherit permissions** from groups.</Tip>

### Best Practices: Users and People

Always work on the principle that one users **equals** one physical person. Never share user accounts across multiple people.

### The Principle of Least Privilege

Only assign a user the **minimum** amount of privileges they need to do their job.

<Tip>Some AWS policies are a **Job function** type.</Tip>

### Identity Providers

Allow you to connect IAM to external identity providers like **Azure AD**, under **IAM** > **Access management** > **Identity providers**.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
**IAM is universal:** It does not apply to regions at this time.

**The Root Account:** The account created when you first set up your AWS account and which has complete admin access. Secure it as soon as possible and **do not** use it to log in day to day.

**New Users:** No permissions when first created.

**Access key ID and secret access keys are not the same as usernames and passwords.**

**You only get to view these once.** If you lose them, you have to regenerate them. So, save them in a secure location.

**Always setup password rotations.** You can create and customize your own password rotation policies.

**IAM Federation:** You can combine your existing user account with AWS. For example, when you log on to your PC (usually using Microsoft Active Directory), you can use the same credentials to log in to AWS if you set up federation.

**Identity Federation in Azure:** Uses the `SAML` standard through Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), which enables seamless and secure authentication across various systems, allowing users to access multiple apps with a single set of credentials.

</Note>

## S3 Overview

### What Is S3

- **Object Storage** - provides secure, durable, highly scalable object storage.
- **Scalable** - store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web at a very low cost.
- **Simple** - easy to use, with a simple web service interface.

**Object-based Storage**

Manages data as objects rather than in file systems or data blocks.

- **Upload any file type** you can think of to S3.
- **Examples** include photos, videos, code, documents, and text files.
- **Cannot** be used to run an operating system or database.

### S3 Basics

- **Unlimited Storage** - the total volume of data and the number of objects you can store is unlimited.
- **Objects up to 5 TB in Size** - S3 objects can range in size from a minimum of 0 bytes to a maximum of 5 TB.
- **S3 Buckets** - store files in buckets (similar to folders).

### Working with S3 Buckets

- **Universal Namespace** - all AWS accounts share the S3 namespace. Each S3 bucket name is globally unique.
- **Example S3 URLs** - `https://bucket-name.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key-name.
- **Uploading Files** - when you upload a file to an S3 bucket, you will receive an HTTP 200 code if the upload was successful.

### Key-Value Store

- **Key** - the name of the object.
- **Value** - the data itself, which is made up of a sequence of bytes.
- **Version ID** - important for storing multiple versions of the same object.
- **Metadata** - data about the data you are storing (e.g. `content-type`, `last-modified`, etc).

### Availability & Durability

The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities to **ensure availability** and **durability**.

- **Built for Availability** - built for 99.95% - 99.99% **service availability**, depending on the S3 tier.
- **Designed for Durability** - designed for 99.999999999% (9 decimal places) durability for **data stored** in S3.
- Suitable for most workloads.
  - The default storage class.
  - Use cases include website, content distribution. mobile and gaming apps, and big data analytics.

### Characteristics

- **Tiered Storage** - S3 offers a range of storage classes designed for different use cases.
- **Lifecycle Management** - define rules to automatically transition objects to a cheaper storage tier or delete objects that are no longer required after a set period of time.
- **Versioning** - with versioning, all versions of an object are stored and can be rertieved, including deleted objects.

### Securing your Data

- **Server-Side Encryption** - you can set default encryption on a bucket to encrypt all new objects whe they are stored in the bucket.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** - define which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access. You can attach S3 ACLs to individual objects within a bucket.
- **Bucket Policies** - S3 bucket policies specify what actions are allowed or denied.

### Consistency Model

**Strong Read-After-Write Consistency**

- **After a successful write** of a new object (`PUT`) or an overwrite of an existing object, any subsequent read request immediately receives the latest version of the object.
- **Strong consistency** for list operations, so after a write, you can immediately perform a listing of the objects in a bucket with all the changes reflected.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
**Object Based** - object based-storage allows you to upload files.

**Files up to 5 TB** - files can from 0 bytes to 5 TB.

**Not OS or DB Storag** - not suitable to install an operating system or run a database on.

**Unlimited Storage** - the total volume of data and the number of objects you can store is unlimited.

S3 is a universal namespace.

Successful CLI or API uploads will generate an **HTTP 200 status code**.

**Key** - the object name.

**Value** - the data itself, which is made up of a sequence of bytes.

**Version ID** - allows you to store multiple versions of the same object.

**Metadata** - data about the data you are storing.

</Note>

## Securing your Bucket with S3 Block Public Access

### Object ACLs vs Bucket Policies

- **Object ACLs** - work on an **individual object** level.
- **Bucket Policies** - work on an **entire bucket** level.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
**Buckets are private by default:** when you create an S3 bucket, it is private by default (including all objects within it). You have to allow public access on both the **bucket** and its **objects** in order to make the bucket public.

**Object ACLs:** you can make **individual objects** public using object ACLs.

**Bucket policies:** you can make **entire buckets** public using bucket policies.

**HTTP status code:** when you upload an object to S3 and it's successful, you will receive an **HTTP 200** code.

</Note>

## Hosting a Static Website

### Static Websites on S3

You can use S3 to host static websites, such as `.html` sites.

- **Dynamic websites**, such as those that require **database connections**, cannot be hosted on S3.

### Automatic Scaling

**S3 scales automatically to meet demand.**

- Many enterprises will put static websites on S3 when they think there is going to be a large number of requests (e.g. for a movie preview).

### Hosting a Static Website

**Enable Static Website Hosting**

- On a **Bucket**, select **Properties**.
- Select `Edit` on **Static website hosting**.
- Toggle `Enable`.
- Toggle `Host a static website`.
- Under **Index document**, enter the home page of the site - `index.html`
- Under **Error document (optional)**, enter the error page of the site - `error.html`.
- Select `Save changes`.

**Upload Site Files**

- On the **Bucket**, select **Objects**.
- Select **Upload**.
- Select **Add files**.

**Enable Public Access**

- On the **Bucket**, select **Permissions**.
- Under **Bucket Policy**, select **Edit**.
- Paste in the policy `json` code.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws::s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Exam Tips

<Note>
**Bucket Policies:** make entire buckets public using bucket policies.

**Static Content:** use S3 to host static content only (not dynamic).

**Automatic Scaling:** S3 scales automatically with demand.

</Note>

## Versioning Objects in S3

### What is Versioning

You can enable versioning in S3 so you can have **multiple versions of an object within S3**.

- **All Versions** - all versions of an object are stored in S3. This includes all writes and even if you delete an object.
- **Backup** - can be a great backup tool.
- **Cannot Be Deleted** - once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled - only suspended.
- **Lifecycle Rules** - can be integrated with lifecycle rules.
- **Supports MFA** - can support multi-factor authentication.

<Note>Previous versions of an object are **not publicly accessible**.</Note>

### Exam Tips

<Note>
**All versions:** all versions of an object are stored in S3. This includes all writes and even if you delete an object.

**Backup:** can be a great backup tool.

**Cannot be Disabled:** once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled - only suspended.

**Lifecycle Rules:** can be integrated with lifecycle rules.

**Suports MFA:** can support multi-factor authentication.

</Note>

## S3 Storage Classes

### S3 Standard

- **High Availability & Durability** - data is stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities (>=3 AZs):

  - 99.99% availability.
  - 99.999999999% durability (11 9's).

- **Designed for Frequent Access** - perfect for frequently accessed data.
- **Suitable for Most Workloads**
  - The default storage class.
  - Use cases include websites, content distribution, mobile and gaming apps, and big data analytics.

### S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)

- **Rapid Access** - used for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed.
- **You Pay to Access the Data** - There is a low per-GB storage price and per-GB retrieval fee.
- **Use Cases** - great for long-term storage, backups, and as a data store for disaster recovery files.

### S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access

Like S3 Standard-IA, but data is stored redundantly within a single AZ.

- Costs **20% less** than regular S3 Standard-IA.
- Great for long-lived, infrequently accessed, non-critical data.
- 99.5% Availability.
- 99.999999999% Durability.

### S3 Intelligent Tiering

**Frequent & Infrequent Access**  
Automatically moves your data to the most cost-effective tier based on how frequently you access each object.

**Optimizes Cost**  
Monthly fee of $0.0025 per 1000 objects.

### 3 Glacier Options

- You pay each time you access your data.
- Use only for archiving data.
- Glacier is cheap storage.
- Optimized for data that is infrequently accessed.

**Option 1 - Glacier Instant Retrieval**  
Provides **long-term data archiving** with instant retrieval time for your data.

**Option 2 - Glacier Flexible Retrieval**  
Ideal storage class for archive data that does not require immediate access but needs the flexibility to retrieve large sets of data at no cost, such as backup or disaster recovery use cases. Can be minutes or up to 12 hours.

**Option 3 - Glacier Deep Archive**  
Cheapest storage class and designed for customers that retain data sets for 7-10 years or longer to meet customer needs and regulatory compliance requirements. The standard retrieval time is 12 hours, and the bulk retrieval time is 48 hours.

## Lifecycle Management with S3

### What is Lifecycle Management

Automates moving your objects between the different storage tiers, thereby maximizing cost effectiveness.

- S3 Standard - Keep for 30 Days.
- S3 IA - After 30 Days.
- Glacier - After 90 Days.

### Lifecycle Management & Versioning

You can use lifecycle management to **move different versions** of objects to **different storage tiers**.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
Automate moving objects between different storage tiers.

Can be used in conjunction with versioning.

Can be applied to current versions and previous versions.

</Note>

## S3 Object Lock and Glacier Vault Lock

### S3 Object Lock

Use to store objects using a **write once, read many (WORM)** model. It can help prevent objects from being deleted or modified for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.

Use to meet regulatory requirements that require WORM storage, or add an extra layer of protection against object changes and deletion.

### Governance Mode

**Users can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings** unless they have special permissions.

Protect objects against being deleted by most users, but you can still grant some users **permission to alter retention settings** or delete the object if necessary.

### Compliance Mode

**A protected object version can't be overwritten or deleted by any user**, including the root user in your AWS account. When an object is locked in compliance mode, its retenetion mode can't be changed and its retention period can't be shortened. Compliance mode ensures an object version **can't be overwritten or deleted** for the duration of the retention period.

### Retention Periods

**Protects an object version for a fixed amount of time**. When you place a retention period on an object version, S3 stores a timestamp in the object version's metadata to indicate when the retention period expires.

After the retention period expires, the object version can be **overwritten or deleted** unless you also placed a legal hold on the object version.

### Legal Holds

Enable you to place a legal hold on an object version. Like a retention period, a legal hold **prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted**. However, legal hold does not have an associated retention period and remains in effect until removed by any user who has the `s3:PutObjectLegalHold` permission.

### Glacier Vault Lock

Allows you to **easily deploy and enforce compliance controls for individual S3 Glacier vaults with a vault lock policy**. You can specify controls, such as WORM, in a vault lock policy and lock the policy from future edits. Once locked, the policy can no longer be changed.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
Use **S3 Object Lock** to store objects using a write once, read many (WORM) model.

Object Lock can be on **individual objects** or applied **across the bucket** as a whole.

Object Lock comes in 2 modes: **governance mode** and **compliance mode**.

**Compliance Mode** - a protected object version can't be overwritten or deleted by any user, including the root user.

**Governance Mode** - users can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings unless they have special permissions.

S3 Glacier Vault Lock allows you to **easily deploy** and **enforce compliance controls** for individual S3 Glacier vaults with a vault lock policy.

You can **specify controls, such as WORM, in a vault lock policy and lock the policy from future edits**. Once locked, the policy can no longer be changed.

</Note>

## Encrypting S3 Objects

### Types of Encryption

**Encryption in Transit**

- SSL/TLS
- HTTPS

**Encryption at Rest: Server-Side Encryption**

- **SSE-S3:** S3-managed keys, using AES 256-bit encryption.
- **SSE-KMS:** AWS Key Management Service-managed keys.
- **SSE-C:** Customer-provided keys.

**Encryption at Rest: Client-Side Encryption**

- Encrypt the files yourself before you upload them to S3.

### Enforcing Server-Side Encrypyion

All Amazon S3 buckets have encryption configured by default. All objects are automatically encrypted by using server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed keys (SSE-S3).

**This encryption applies to all objects in your Amazon S3 buckets.**

Every time a file is uploaded to S3, a `PUT` request is initiated.

**`x-amz-server-side-encryption`**  
If the file is to be encrypted at upload time, this parameter will be included in the request header.

**2 Options**

- `x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256` (SSE-S3 - S3-managed keys)
- `x-amz-server-side-encryption: aws:kms` (SSE-KMS - KMS-managed keys)

**`PUT` Request Header**  
When this parameter is included in the header of the `PUT` request, it tells S3 to encrypt the object at the time of upload, using the specified encryption method.

You can create a bucket policy that denies any S3 `PUT` request that doesn't include the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` parameter in the request header.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
**Encryption in Transit**  
SSL/TLS  
HTTPS

**Encryption at Rest: SSE**  
Server-Side Encryption  
SSE-S3 (AES-256-bit)  
SSE-KMS  
SSE-C

**Client-Side Encryption**  
You encrypt the files yourself before you upload them to S3.

**Enforcing Encryption with a Bucket Policy**  
A bucket policy can deny all `PUT` requests that don't include the `x-amz-server-side-encryption` parameter in the request header.

</Note>

## Optimizing S3 Performance

### S3 Prefixes

- `mybucketname/folder1/subfolder1/myfile.jpg` > **/folder1/subfolder1**
- `mybucketname/folder2/subfolder1/myfile.jpg` > **/folder2/subfolder1**
- `mybucketname/folder3/myfile.jpg` > **/folder3**
- `mybucketname/folder4/subfolder4/myfile.jpg` > **/folder4/subfolder4**

### S3 Performance

S3 has extremely low latency. You can get the first byte out of S3 within **100-200 milliseconds**.

You can also achieve a high number of requests: **3500 `PUT`/`COPY`/`POST`/`DELETE`** and **5500 `GET`/`HEAD`** requests per second, per prefix.

You can get better performance by spreading your reads across **different prefixes**. For example, if you are using **2 prefixes**, you can achieve **22000 requests per second**.

### Limitations with KMS

S3 limitations when using KMS

- If you are using **SSE-KMS** to encrypt your objects in S3, you must keep in mind the **KMS limits**.
- When you **upload** a file, you will call `GenerateDataKey` in the KMS API.
- When you **download** a file, you will call `Decrypt` in the KMS API.

**KMS Request Rates**

- Uploading/downloading will count toward the **KMS quota**.
- Currently, you **cannot** request a quota increase for KMS.
- Region-specific, however, it's either **5500**, **10000**, or **30000** requests per second.

### S3 Performance: Uploads

**Multipart Uploads**

- Recommended for files **over 100 MB**.
- Required for files **over 5 GB**.
- Parallelize uploads (increases **efficiency**).

### S3 Performance: Downloads

**S3 Byte-Range Fetches**

- Parallelize **downloads** by specifying byte ranges.
- If there's a failure in the download, it's only for a specific byte range.
- Can be used to **speed up** downloads.
- Can be used to download **partial amounts of the file** (e.g. header information).

### Exam Tips

<Note>
`mybucketname/folder1/subfolder1/myfile.jpg` > **/folder1/subfolder1**

You can also achieve a high number of requests: **3500 `PUT`/`COPY`/`POST`/`DELETE`** and **5500 `GET`/`HEAD`** requests per second, per prefix.

You can get better performance by spreading your reads across **different prefixes**. For example, if you are using **2 prefixes**, you can achieve **11000 requests per second**.

Uploading/downloading will count toward the **KMS quota**.

Region-specific, however, it's either **5500**, **10000**, or **30000** requests per second.

Currently, you **cannot** request a quota increase for KMS.

Use **multipart uploads** to increase performance when **uploading files** to S3.

Should be used for any files **over 100 MB** and must be used for any file **over 5 GB**.

Use **S3 byte-range fetches** to increase performance when **downloading files** to S3.

</Note>

## Backing up Data with S3

### S3 Replication

**You can replicate objects from one bucket to another.**  
Versioning must be enabled on both the source and destination buckets.

**Objects in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically.**  
Once replication is turned on, all subsequent updated objects will be replicated automatically.

**Delete markers are not replicated by default.**  
Deleting individual versions or delete markers will not be replicated.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
You can **replicate objects** from one bucket to another.

Objects in an existing bucket are **not replicated automatically**.

Delete markers are **not replicated by default**.

</Note>

## Lab: Creating S3 Buckets, Managing Objects, and Enabling Versioning

### Create a Public and Private Amazon S3 Bucket

**Create a Public Bucket**

- Navigate to S3.
- Click **Create bucket**.
- Set the following values:
  - **Bucket name**: Enter `acg-testlab-public-<random>`, where `<random>` is a random string of characters to make the bucket name globally unique (e.g., `acg-testlab-4324yr-public`).
  - **Region**: Select **US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1**.
  - **Object Ownership**: Select **ACLs enabled** and **Bucket owner preferred**.
- In the **Block Public Access settings for this bucket** section, uncheck the box for **Block all public access**.
- Check the box stating **I acknowledge that the current settings might result in this bucket and the objects within becoming public** to confirm that we understand the bucket is going to be public
- Leave the rest of the settings as their defaults.
- Click **Create bucket**.

**Create a Private Bucket**

- On the **Buckets** screen, click **Create bucket**.
- Set the following values:
  - **Bucket name**: Enter `acg-testlab-private-<random>`, where `<random>` is a random string of characters to make the bucket name globally unique (you can use the same string from your public bucket).
  - **Region**: Select **US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1**.
- Leave the rest of the settings as their defaults.
- Click **Create bucket**.

**Upload a File in the Private Bucket**

## Overview

### Introduction

**Secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.**

- Like a VM, only hosted in AWS instead of your own data center.
- Designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers.
- The capacity you want when you need it.

**Game Changer**

- AWS led a big change in the industry by introducing EC2.

**Pay Only for What You Use**

- EC2 changed the economics of computing.

**No Wasted Capacity**

- Select the capacity you need right now. Grow and shrink when you need.

**On-Premises Infrastructure**

- Estimate capacity.
- Long-term investment, 3-5 years.
- Several days to provision extra capacity.

### EC2 Pricing Options

**On-Demand:** Pay by the hour or the second, depending on the type of instance you run.

**Super Flexible**

- Not only EC2, this also includes serverless technologies like Lambda and Fargate.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
  EC2 is like a VM, hosted in AWS instead of your own data center. Select the
  capacity you need right now. Grow and shrink when you need.  
  Pay for what you use.  
  Wait minutes, not months.

**On-Demand**  
Pay by the hour or the second, depending on the type of instance you run. Great for flexiblity.

**Reserved**  
Reserved capacity for 1 or 3 years. Up to 72% discount on the hourly charge. Great if you have known, fixed requirements.

**Spot**  
Purchase unused capacity at a discount of up to 90%. Prices fluctuate with supply and demand. Great for apps with flexible start and end times.

**Dedicated**  
A physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Great if you have server-bound licenses to reuse or compliance requirements.

</Note>

## AWS Command Line

### The AWS Management Console

The Graphical User Interface (GUI) that can interact with AWS.

### Command Line Interactions

You can also **interact with AWS** using the Command Line.

### Lesson Objectives

- **Launch an EC2 Instance** - using the AWS CLI.
- **Create an IAM User** - give the user permissions to access and create S3 resources.
- **Configure the AWS CLI** - configure the CLI using the IAM user's credentials. Use the CLI to create an S3 bucket and upload a file.

### AWS CLI

**Create an IAM User**

- Under **IAM**, select **User groups**.
- Select **Create Group**.
- Add a **User group name**.
- Under **Attach permissions policies - _Optional_**, search for `s3`.
- Check the box for `AmazonS3FullAccess`.
- Select **Create group**.
- Under **IAM**, select **Users**.
- Select **Create user**.
- Add a **User name**.
- Select **Next**.
- Check the box for **Add user to group**.
- Under **User groups**, select the new group.
- Select **Next**.
- Select **Create user**.
- Select the new user.
- Select the **Security Credentials**.
- Under **Access keys**, select **Create access keys**.
- Select **Command Line Interface (CLI)**.
- Check the box for **I understand the above recommendation and want to proceed to create an access key**.
- Select **Next**.
- Select **Create access key**.
- Copy the **Access key**.
- Copy the **Secret access key**.

**Configure the AWS CLI**

- Elevate your privileges:

```sh
sudo su
```

- Configure the AWS profile:

```sh
aws configure
```

- Paste the **Access key**.
- Paste the **Secret access keys**.
- Optionally enter a `region name`.
- Optionally enter an `output format`.

- List S3 buckets:

```sh
aws s3 ls
```

- "Make" a bucket:

```sh
aws s3 mb s3://<name>
```

### Exam Tips

<Note>
**Least Privilege**  
Always give your users the **minimum amount** of access required to do their job.

**Use Groups**  
**Create IAM groups** and assign users to groups. Group permissions are assigned using IAM policy documents. Your users will **automatically inherit** the permissions of the group.

**Secret Access Key**  
You will only see this once! If you lose it, you can delete the access key ID and secret access key and regenerate them. You will need to run `aws configure` again.

**Don't Share Key Pairs**  
Each developer should have their own access key ID and secret access key. Just like passwords, they should not be shared.

**Supports Linux, Windows, MacOS**  
You can install the CLI on your Mac, Linux, or Windows PC. You can also use it on EC2 instances.

</Note>

## Using Roles

### What is an IAM Role

A role is an identity you can create in IAM that has specific permissions. A role is similar to a user, as it is an AWS identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS.

However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it.

### Roles are Temporary

A role does not have standard long-term credentials the same way passwords or access keys do. Instead, when you assume a role, it provides you with temporary security credentials for your role session.

### What Else Can Roles Do

Roles can be assumed by people, AWS architecture, or other system-level accounts.

Roles can allow cross-account access. This allows one AWS account the ability to interact with resources in other AWS accounts.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
**The Preferred Option**  
Roles are preferred from a security perspective.

**Avoid Hard-Coding Your Credentials**  
Roles allow you to provide access without the use of access key IDs and secret access keys.

**Policies**  
Policies control a role's permissions.

**Updates**  
You can update a policy attached to a role, and it will take immediate effect.

**Attaching and Detaching**  
You can attach and detach roles to running EC2 instances without having to stop or terminate those instances.

</Note>

## Security Groups and Bootstrap Scripts

### How Humans Sense Things

**Light**  
We see light using our **eyes**.

**Sound**  
We hear sound using our **ears**.

**Heat**  
We feel heat using our **skin**.

### How Computers Communicate

- **Linux** - SSH - Port `22`.
- **Windows** - RDP - Port `3389`.
- **HTTP** - Web Browsing - Port `80`.
- **HTTPS** - Encrypted Web Browsing (SSL) - Port `443`.

### Security Groups

Security groups are **virtual firewalls for your EC2 instance.** By default, everything is blocked.

<Tip>To let everything in: `0.0.0.0/0`.</Tip>

In order to be able to **communicate to your EC2 instances via SSH/RDP/HTTP**, you will need to **open the correct ports**.

### Bootstrap Scripts

Scripts that run when the instance first starts.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

yum update -y
# installs apache
yum install httpd -y
# starts apache
yum service httpd start
cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><body><h1>Hello World</h1></body></html>" > index.html
```

Adding these tasks at boot time **adds to the amount of time it takes to boot the instance**. However, it allows you to **automate the installation** of apps.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
Changes to security groups take effect immediately.

You can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group.

You can have multiple security groups attached to EC2 instances.

All inbound traffic is blocked by default.

All outbound traffic is allowed.

A bootstrap script is **a script that runs when the instance first runs.** It passes user data to the EC2 instance and can be used to install apps (like web servers and databases), as well as do updates and more.

</Note>

## EC2 Metadata and User Data

### What is EC2 Metadata

It is simply data about your EC2 instance.

- This can include information such as private IP addresses, public IP address, hostname, security groups, etc.

### Retrieving Metadata

Using the `curl` command, we can query metadata about our EC2 instance.

```sh
TOKEN=`curl -X PUT "http://52.71.116.78/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600"` \
&& curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" -v http://52.71.116.78/latest/meta-data/
ami-id
ami-launch-index
ami-manifest-path
block-device-mapping/
events/
hibernation/
hostname
identity-credentials/
instance-action
instance-id
instance-life-cycle
instance-type
local-hostname
local-ipv4
mac
managed-ssh-keys/
metrics/
network/
placement/
profile
public-hostname
public-ipv4
public-keys/
reservation-id
security-groups
```

### Using User Data to Save Metadata

```sh
#!/bin/bash

yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
cd /var/www/html
echo "<html><body><h1>My IP is " > index.html
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X PUT "http://52.71.116.78/latest/api/token" -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600")
PUBLIC_IP=$(curl -s -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" http://52.71.116.78/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4)
echo "$PUBLIC_IP" >> index.html
echo "</h1></body></html>" >> index.html
```

### Exam Tips

<Note>
User data is simply bootstrap scripts.

Metadata is data stored about your EC2 instances.

You can use bootstrap scripts (user data) to access metadata.

</Note>

## Networking with EC2

### Different Virtual Networking Options

You can attach 3 different types of **virtual networking cards** to your EC2 instances.

- **ENI - Elastic Network Interface** - for basic, day-to-day networking.
- **EN - Enhanced Networking** - uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high performance.
- **EFA - Elastic Fabric Adapter** - accelerates High Performance Computing (HPC) and machine learning apps.

### ENI

A virtual network card that allows:

- Private IPv4 Addresses
- Public IPv4 Address
- Many IPv6 Addresses
- MAC Address
- 1 or more Security Groups

Common ENI use cases:

- Create a management network.
- Use network and security appliances in your VPC.
- Create dual-homed instances with workloads/roles on distinct subnets.
- Create a low-budget, high-availability solution.

### Enhanced Networking

For high-performance networking between 10 - 100 Gbps.

**Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV)**

- SR-IOV provides higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization.

**Performance**

- Provides higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, and consistently lower inter-instance latencies.

### ENA vs VF

Depending on your instance type, enhanced networking can be enabled using:

| Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)                                          | Intel 82599 Virtual Function (VF) Interface                                                               |
| :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Supports network speeds of up to 100 Gbps for supported instance types | Supports network speeds of up to 10 Gbps for supported instance types. Typically used on older instances. |

<Tip>In any scenario question: choose ENA of VF interface.</Tip>

### EFA

Elastic Fabric Adapter

- A network device you can attach to your Amazon EC2 instance to accelerate High Performance Computing (HPC) and machine learning apps.
- Provides lower and more consistent latency and higher throughput that the TCP transport traditionally used in cloud-based HPC systems.

<Tip>
EFA can use OS-bypass.

It makes it a lot **faster** with much **lower latency**.

OS-bypass enables HPC and machine learning apps to bypass the operating system kernel and communicate directly with the EFA device. Not currently supported with Windows - only Linux.

</Tip>

### Exam Tips

<Note>
**ENI**  
For basic networking. Perhaps you need a separate management network from your production network or a separate logging network, and you need to do this at a low cost. In this scenario, use multiple ENIs for each network.

**Enhanced Networking**  
For when you need speeds between 10 Gbps and 100 Gbps. Anywhere you need reliable, high throughput.

**EFA**  
For when you need to accelerate High Performance Computing (HPC) and machine learning apps or if you need to do an OS-bypass. If you see a scenario question mentioning HPC or ML and asking what network adapter you want, choose EFA.

</Note>

## Optimizing with EC2 Placement Groups

### 3 Types of Placement Groups

- Cluster
- Spread
- Partition

### Cluster Placement Groups

Grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. Recommended for apps that need low network latency, high network throughput, or both.

<Note>
  Only certain instance types can be launched into a cluster placement group.
</Note>

### Spread Placement Groups

A group of instances that are **each placed on distinct underlying hardware**. Recommended for apps that have small number of critical instances that should be kept separate from each other.

<Tip>Used for individual instances.</Tip>

### Partition Placement Groups

Each partition placement group has its own set of racks. Each rack has its own network and power source. No 2 partitions within a placement group share the same racks, allowing you to isolate the impact of hardware failure within your app.

EC2 divides each group into logical segments called **partitions**.

### Exam Tips

 <Note>
**Cluster Placement Groups**  
Low network latency, high network throughput.

**Spread Placement Groups**  
Individual critical EC2 instances.

**Partition Placement Groups**  
Multiple EC2 instances; HDFS, HBase, and Cassandra.

A **cluster placement group** can't span mulitple Availability Zones, whereas a spread placement group and partition placement group can.

Only **certain types of instances** can be launched in a placement group (compute optimized, GPU, memory optimized, storage optimized).

**AWS recommends homogenous instances** within cluster placement groups.

**You can't merge placement groups.**

You can **move an existing instance into a placement group.** Before you move the instance, the instance must be in a stopped state. You can move or remove an instance using the AWS CLI or an AWS SDK, but you can't do it via the console yet.

 </Note>

## Solving Licensing Issues with Dedicated Hosts

### The Different Pricing Models for EC2

**On-Demand**  
Pay by the hour or the second, depedning on the type of instance you run.

**Reserved**  
Reserved capacity for 1 or 3 years. Up to 72% discount on the hourly change.

**Spot**  
Purchase unused capacity at a discount of up to 90%. Prices fluctuate with supply and demand.

**Dedicated**  
A physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. The most expensive option.

### Dedicated Hosts

**Compliance**  
Regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization.

**Licensing**  
Great for licensing that does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments.

**On-Demand**  
Can be purchased on-demand (hourly).

**Reserved**  
Can be purchased as a reservation for up to 70% off the on-demand price.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
  **Any question that talks about special licensing requirements.** A **Amazon
  EC2 Dedicated Host** is a **physical server** with EC2 instance capacity fully
  dedicated to your use. Hosts allow you to **use your existing** per-socket,
  per-core, or per-VM software **licenses**, including Windows Server, Microsoft
  SQL Server, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.
</Note>

## Timing Workloads with Spot Instances and Spot Fleets

### What are EC2 Spot Instances

Spot instances let you take advantage of unused EC2 capacity in the AWS cloud. Spot instances are available at up to 90% discount compared to On-Demand prices.

### When to Use Spot Instances

**Stateless, fault-tolerant, or flexible applications**  
Applications such as big data, containerized workloads, CI/CD, high-performance computing (HPC), and other test and development workloads.

### Spot Prices

To use **Spot Instances**, you must first decide on your maximum Spot price. The instance will be provisioned so long as the Spot price is **BELOW** your maximum Spot price.

The hourly Spot price varies depending on capacity and region.

If the Spot price goes beyond your maximum, **you have 2 minutes to choose whether to stop or terminate your instance**.

### Use Cases

- Big data and analysis.
- Containerized workloads.
- CI/CD Testing
- Image and media rendering.
- High-performance computing.

Spot instances are not good for:

- Persistent workloads.
- Critical jobs.
- Databases.

### Terminating Spot Instances

![Terminating Spot Instances](../images/terminating-spot-instances.png)

![Terminating Spot Instances Contd](../images/terminating-spot-instances-contd.png)

[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-requests.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-requests.html)

### Spot Blocks

Stop instances from terminating.

### What are Spot Fleets

**A collection of Spot Instances and (optionally) On-demand Instances.**

The **Spot Fleet** attempts to launch the nunber of Spot instances and On-Demand instances to meet the target capacity you specified in the Spot Fleet request.

The request for Spot Instances is fulfilled if there is available capacity and the **maximum price you specified in the request exceeds the current Spot price**.

The Spot Fleet also attempts to maintain its target capacity fleet if your Spot Instances are interrupted.

### Launch Pools

Spot Fleets will try and match the target capacity with your price restraints.

- Set up different launch pools. Define things like **EC2** instance type, operating system, and Availability Zone.
- You can have **multiple** pools, and the fleet will choose the best way to implement depending on the strategy you define.
- Spot fleets will **stop launching instances** once you reach your price thershold or capacity price.

### Strategies

**`capacityOptimized`**  
The Spot Instances come from the pool with optimal capacity for the number of instances launching.

**`lowestPrice`**  
The Spot Instances come from a pool with the lowest price. This is the default strategy.

**`diversified`**  
The Spot Instances are distributed across all pools.

**`InstancePoolsToUseCount`**  
The Spot instances are distributed across the number of Spot Instance pools you specify. This parameter is valid only when used in combination with `lowestPrice`.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
Spot Instances save up to **90%** percent of the cost of On-Demand instances.

Useful for any type of computing where you don't need **persistent storage**.

You can block Spot Instances from terminating by using a **Spot Block**.

A Spot Fleet is a collection of Spot Instances and (optionally) On-Demand instances.

</Note>

## Lab: EC2 Instance Bootstrapping

### Manually Install Software on `webserver-01`

**Set up `apache2`**

1. From the AWS Management Console, navigate to EC2.
2. In **Resources** at the top, click \*\*Instances (running).
3. Select the `webserver-01` instance and click **Connect**.
4. Select **EC2 Instance Connect** and click **Connect** to open a terminal window. (Alternatively, you can also use your own local terminal to log in to the server using the credentials provided on the lab page for **Cloud Server of webserver-01**.)

```sh
ssh cloud_user@<PUBLIC_IP_ADDRESS>
```

5. Update and install the packages, using the same password as before, when prompted:

```sh
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

<Note>Note: It may take a few minutes to complete.</Note>

6. Install the `apache2` web server:

```sh
sudo apt-get install apache2 -y
```

7. Once installed, return to the AWS Management Console to confirm the `apache2` install was successful:

- Click the checkbox next to **webserver-01**.
- Scroll down to the Details section of the page and copy the Public IPv4 address.
- Paste the IP address in the address bar of a new browser tab.

<Note>
  Note: If using the open address link, you may receive an error that the site
  can't be reached. This is because the link defaults to HTTPS instead of HTTP.
  In the address URL, change HTTPS to HTTP to load the Apache2 default welcome
  page.
</Note>

**Set Up the AWL CLI Tool**

1. Return to the terminal window and install the `unzip` tool:

```sh
sudo apt-get install unzip -y
```

2. Download the AWS CLI tool:

```sh
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
```

3. Unzip the file:

```sh
unzip awscliv2.zip
```

4. Install the AWS CLI tool:

```sh
sudo ./aws/install
```

5. Verify AWS CLI version 2 has been installed:

```sh
aws --version
```

6. To edit the web page's `index.html` file, you'll need to grant user access to the file:

```sh
sudo chmod 777 /var/www/html/index.html
```

7. To get instance metadata about the server's Availability Zone, enter the following command Observe the Availability Zone is listed at the front of the username in the result:

```sh
curl http://52.71.116.78/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone
```

<Note>
  Note: If you don't see any output, wait a moment and retry the command.
</Note>

8. Add the Availability Zone, instance ID, public IP, and local IP instance metadata to the `index.html` file (paste all of this into the terminal):

```sh
echo '<html><h1>Bootstrap Demo</h1><h3>Availability Zone: ' > /var/www/html/index.html
curl http://52.71.116.78/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone >> /var/www/html/index.html
echo '</h3> <h3>Instance Id: ' >> /var/www/html/index.html
curl http://52.71.116.78/latest/meta-data/instance-id >> /var/www/html/index.html
echo '</h3> <h3>Public IP: ' >> /var/www/html/index.html
curl http://52.71.116.78/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4 >> /var/www/html/index.html
echo '</h3> <h3>Local IP: ' >> /var/www/html/index.html
curl http://52.71.116.78/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4 >> /var/www/html/index.html
echo '</h3></html> ' >> /var/www/html/index.html
```

9. Navigate back to the Apache web page, and refresh it to view the results of the changes you made.
10. Return to the terminal and install `mysql`:

```sh
sudo apt-get install mysql-server -y
```

<Note>Note: It may take a few minutes for MySQL to install.</Note>

sudo systemctl status mysql
```

8. Try using `mysqld`:

```sh
sudo systemctl status mysql
```

9. Check for any running `mysql` processes:

```sh
ps aux | grep mysql
```

10. Try to start the `mysql` service:

```sh
sudo systemctl start mysql
```

<Note>
  Note: These commands should all return an error that the mysql service was not
  found.
</Note>

11. Use `curl` to retrieve the `user-data`:

```sh
curl http://52.71.116.78/latest/user-data
```

12. At the bottom of the script, notice the following code:

```sh
sudo apt-get install mysql-server
```

13. Observe the code is missing the `-y` flag needed for `mysql` to automatically install without a user prompt.

Install `mysql-server` manually:

```sh
sudo apt-get install mysql-server -y
```

14. Enable the `mysql` service:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable mysql
```

## Lab: EC2 Roles and Instance Profiles in AWS

### Create a Trust Policy and Role Using the AWS CLI

**Obtain the `labreferences.txt` File**

1. Navigate to S3.
2. From the list of buckets, open the one that contains the text `s3bucketlookupfiles` in the middle of its name.
3. Select the `labreferences.txt` file.
4. Click **Actions** > **Download**.
5. Open the `labreferences.txt` file, as we will need to reference it throughout the lab.

**Log in to Bastion Host and Set the AWS CLI Region and Output Type**

1. Navigate to **EC2** > **Instances**.
2. Copy the public IP of the Bastion Host instance.
3. Open a terminal, and log in to the bastion host via SSH:

```sh
ssh cloud_user@<BASTION_HOST_PUBLIC_IP>
```

For more information on how to connect to a Linux instance using SSH, please refer to the [AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html). For more information on how to connect to a Linux instance using Putty, please refer to [Connect to your Linux instance from Windows using PuTTY](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/putty.html).

4. Enter the password provided for it on the lab page.
5. Run the following command:

```
[cloud_user@bastion]$ aws configure
```

6. Press **Enter** twice to leave the AWS Access Key ID and AWS Secret Access Key blank.
7. Enter `us-east-1` as the default region name.
8. Enter `json` as the default output format.

**Create IAM Trust Policy for an EC2 Role**

1. Create a file called `trust_policy_ec2.json`:

```sh
[cloud_user@bastion]$ nano trust_policy_ec2.json
```

2. Paste in the following content:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": { "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com" },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Save and quit the file by pressing `^X`, `Y` to save, and hit **return** to accept the existing file name.

**Create the DEV_ROLE IAM Role**

1. Run the following AWS CLI command:

```sh
[cloud_user@bastion]$ aws iam create-role --role-name DEV_ROLE --assume-role-policy-document file://trust_policy_ec2.json
```

**Create an IAM Policy Defining Read-Only Access Permissions to an S3 Bucket**

1. Create a file called `dev_s3_read_access.json`:

```sh
[cloud_user@bastion]$ nano dev_s3_read_access.json
```

2. Enter the following content, replacing `<DEV_S3_BUCKET_NAME>` with the bucket name provided in the `labreferences.txt` file:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowUserToSeeBucketListInTheConsole",
      "Action": ["s3:ListAllMyBuckets", "s3:GetBucketLocation"],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::*"]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:Get*", "s3:List*"],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::<DEV_S3_BUCKET_NAME>/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::<DEV_S3_BUCKET_NAME>"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

3. Save and quit the file by pressing `^X`, `Y` to save, and hit **return** to accept the existing file name.
4. Create the managed policy called `DevS3ReadAccess`:

```sh
[cloud_user@bastion]$ aws iam create-policy --policy-name DevS3ReadAccess --policy-document file://dev_s3_read_access.json
```

5. Copy the policy ARN in the output, and paste it into the `labreferences.txt` file — we'll need it in a minute.

### Create Instance Profile and Attach Role to an EC2 Instance

**Attach Managed Policy to Role**

1. Attach the managed policy to the role, replacing `<DevS3ReadAccess_POLICY_ARN>` with the ARN you just copied:

```sh
[cloud_user@bastion]$ aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name DEV_ROLE --policy-arn "<DevS3ReadAccess_POLICY_ARN>"
```

2. Verify the managed policy was attached:

```sh
[cloud_user@bastion]$ aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name DEV_ROLE
```

**Create the Instance Profile and Add the DEV_ROLE via the AWS CLI**

1. Create instance profile named `DEV_PROFILE`:

```sh
[cloud_user@bastion]$ aws iam create-instance-profile --instance-profile-name DEV_PROFILE
```

2. Add role to the `DEV_PROFILE` called `DEV_ROLE`:

```sh
[cloud_user@bastion]$ aws iam add-role-to-instance-profile --instance-profile-name DEV_PROFILE --role-name DEV_ROLE
```

3. Verify the configuration:

```sh
[cloud_user@bastion]$ aws iam get-instance-profile --instance-profile-name DEV_PROFILE
```

**Attach the `DEV_PROFILE` Role to an Instance**

1. In the AWS console, navigate to **EC2** > **Instances**.
2. Copy the instance ID of the instance named Web Server instance and paste it into the `labreferences.txt` file — we'll need it in a second.
3. In the terminal, attach the `DEV_PROFILE` to an EC2 instance, replacing `<LAB_WEB_SERVER_INSTANCE_ID>` with the Web Server instance ID you just copied:

```sh
[cloud_user@bastion]$ aws ec2 associate-iam-instance-profile --instance-id <LAB_WEB_SERVER_INSTANCE_ID> --iam-instance-profile Name="DEV_PROFILE"
```

4. Verify the configuration (be sure to replace `<LAB_WEB_SERVER_INSTANCE_ID>` with the Web Server instance ID again):

```sh
[cloud_user@bastion]$ aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <LAB_WEB_SERVER_INSTANCE_ID>
```

This command's output should show this instance is using `DEV_PROFILE` as an `IamInstanceProfile`. Verify this by locating the `IamInstanceProfile` section in the output, and look below to make sure the `"Arn"` ends in `/DEV_PROFILE`.

### Test S3 Permissions via the AWS CLI

1. In the AWS console, copy the public IP of the Web Server instance.
2. Open a new terminal.
3. Log in to the web server instance via SSH:

```sh
ssh cloud_user@<WEB_SERVER_PUBLIC_IP>
```

4. Use the same password for the bastion host provided on the lab page.
5. Verify the instance is assuming the `DEV_ROLE` role:

```sh
[cloud_user@webserver]$ aws sts get-caller-identity
```

We should see `DEV_ROLE` in the `Arn`.

6. List the buckets in the account:

```sh
[cloud_user@webserver]$ aws s3 ls
```

Copy the entire name (starting with `cfst`) of the bucket with `s3bucketdev` in its name.

7. Attempt to view the files in the `s3bucketdev-` bucket, replacing `<s3bucketdev-123>` with the bucket name you just copied:

```sh
[cloud_user@webserver]$ aws s3 ls s3://<s3bucketdev-123>
```

We should see a list of files.

### Create an IAM Policy and Role Using the AWS Management Console

**Create Policy**

1. In the AWS console, navigate to **IAM** > **Policies**.
2. Click **Create policy**.
3. Click the **JSON** tab.
4. Paste the following text as the policy, replacing `<PROD_S3_BUCKET_NAME>` with the bucket name provided in the `labreferences.txt` file:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "AllowUserToSeeBucketListInTheConsole",
      "Action": ["s3:ListAllMyBuckets", "s3:GetBucketLocation"],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::*"]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": ["s3:Get*", "s3:List*"],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::<PROD_S3_BUCKET_NAME>/*",
        "arn:aws:s3:::<PROD_S3_BUCKET_NAME>"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

5. Click **Next**.
6. Enter `ProdS3ReadAccess` as the policy name.
7. Click **Create policy**.

**Create Role**

1. Click **Roles** in the left-hand menu.
2. Click **Create role**.
3. Under Choose a use case, select **EC2**.
4. Click **Next**.
5. In the Filter policies search box, enter `ProdS3ReadAccess`.
6. Click the checkbox to select `ProdS3ReadAccess`.
7. Click **Next**.
8. Give it a Role name of `PROD_ROLE`.
9. Click **Create role**.

### Attach IAM Role to an EC2 Instance Using the AWS Management Console

1. Navigate to **EC2** > **Instances**.
2. Select the Web Server instance.
3. Click **Actions** > **Security** > **Modify IAM role**.
4. In the IAM role dropdown, select `PROD_ROLE`.
5. Click **Update IAM role**.

**Test the Configuration**

1. Open the existing terminal connected to the Web Server instance. (You may need to reconnect if you've been disconnected.)
2. Determine the identity currently being used:

```sh
[cloud_user@webserver]$ aws sts get-caller-identity
```

This time, we should see `PROD_ROLE` in the `Arn`.

3. List the buckets:

```sh
[cloud_user@webserver]$ aws s3 ls
```

4. Copy the entire name (starting with `cfst`) of the bucket with `s3bucketprod` in its name.
5. Attempt to view the files in the `s3bucketprod-` bucket, replacing `<s3bucketprod-123>` with the bucket name you just copied:

```sh
[cloud_user@webserver]$ aws s3 ls s3://<s3bucketprod-123>
```

It should list the files.

6. In the `aws s3 ls` command output, copy the entire name (starting with `cfst`) of the bucket with `s3bucketsecret` in its name.
7. Attempt to view the files in the `<s3bucketsecret-123>` bucket, replacing `<s3bucketsecret-123>` with the bucket name you just copied:

```sh
[cloud_user@webserver]$ aws s3 ls s3://<s3bucketsecret-123>
```

This time, our access will be denied — which means our configuration is properly set up.

## Quiz: Elastic Cloud Compute EC2

## EBS Overview

### Understanding EBS Volumes

**Elastic Block Store**

Storage volumes you can attach to your EC2 instances.

Use them the same way you would use any system disk.

- Create a file system.
- Run a database.
- Run an operating system.
- Store data.
- Install applications.

### Mission Critical

**Production Workloads**  
Designed for mission-critical workloads.

**Highly Available**  
Automatically replicated within a single Availability Zone to protect against hardware failures.

**Scalable**  
Dynamically increase capacity and change the volume type with no downtime or performance impact to your live systems.

### Solid State Disk

**General Purpose SSD (`gp2`)**

- 3 IOPS per GiB, **up to maximum of 16000 IOPS per volume**.
- `gp2` volumes **smaller than 1 TB** can burst up to 3000 IOPS.
- **Good for boot volumes** or development and test applications that are not latency sensitive.

**General Purpose SSD (`gp3`)**

## Volumes and Snapshots

### What are Volumes

- Volumes exist on EBS
- Volumes are simply virtual hard disks.
- You need a minimum of 1 volume per EC2 instance.
- **This is called the root device volume.**

### What are Snapshots

**Snapshots exist on S3**  
Think of snapshots as a photograph of the virtual disk/volume.

**Snapshots are point in time**  
When you take a snapshot, it is a point-in-time copy of a volume.

**Snapshots are incremental**  
This means only the data that has been changed since your last snapshot are moved to S3. This saves dramatically on space and the time it takes to take a snapshot.

**The first snapshot**  
If it is your first snapshot, it may take some time to create as there is no previous point-in-time copy.

### 3 Tips for Snapshots

**Consistent Snapshots**  
Snapshots only capture data that has been written to your Amazon EBS volume, which might exclude any data that has been locally cached by your application or OS. For a consistent snapshot, it is recommended you stop the instance and take a snap.

**Encrypted Snapshots**  
If you take a snapshot of an encrypted EBS volume, the snapshot will be encrypted automatically.

**Sharing Snapshots**  
You can share snapshots, but only in the region in which they were created. To share to other regions, you will need to copy them to the destination region first.

### What to Know about EBS Volumes

**Location - EBS volumes will always be in the same AZ as EC2.**  
Your EBS volumes will always be in the same AZ as the EC2 instance to which it is attached.

**Resizing - Resize on the fly.**  
You can resize EBS volumes on the fly. You do not need to stop or restart the instance. However, you will need to extend the filesystem in the OS so the OS can see the resized volume.

**Volume Type - Switch volume types**  
You can change the volume types on the fly (e.g. go from `gp2` to `io2`). You do not need to stop or restart the instance.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
Volumes exist on EBS, whereas snapshots exist on S3.

Snapshots are point-in-time photographs of volumes and are in incremental in nature.

The first snapshot will take some time to create. For consistent snapshots, stop the instance and detach the volume.

You can share snapshots between AWS accounts as well as between regions, but first you need to copy that snapshot to the target region.

You can resize EBS volumes on the fly as well as changing the volume types.

</Note>

## Protecting EBS Volumes with Encryption

### EBS Encryption

- EBS encrypts your volume with a data key using the industry-standard AES-256 algorithm.
- Amazon EBS encryption uses AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master keys (CMK) when creating encrypted volumes and snapshots.

### What Happens When You Encrypt

- Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume.
- All data in flight moving between the instance and the volume is encrypted.
- All snapshots are encrypted.
- All volumes created from the snapshot are encrypted.

### Encryption Explored

**Handled Transparently**  
Encryption and decryption are handled transparently (you don't need to do anything).

**Latency**  
Encryption has a minimal impact on latency.

**Copying**  
Copying an unencrypted snapshot allows encryption.

**Snapshots**  
Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted.

**Root Device Volumes**  
You can now encrypt root device volumes upon creation.

### How to Encrypt Existing Volumes

- Create a snapshot of the unencrypted root device volume.
- Create a copy of the snapshot and select the encrypt option.
- Create an AMI from the encrypted snapshot.
- Use that AMI to launch new encrypted instances.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume.

All data in flight moving between the instance and the volume is encrypted.

All snapshots are encrypted.

All volumes created from the snapshot are encrypted.

Create a snapshot of the unencrypted root device volume.

Create a copy of the snapshot and select the encrypt option.

Create an AMI from the encrypted snapshot.

Use that AMI to launch new encrypted instances.

</Note>

## EC2 Hibernation

### EBS Behaviors Reviewed

- If an instance is stopped, the **data is kept on the disk (with EBS)** and will remain on the disk until the EC2 instance is started.
- If an instance is terminated, then by default **the root device volume will also be terminated**.

When an EC2 instance is started:

- **Operating system** boots up.
- User data script is run (**bootstrap scripts**).
- **Applications start** (can take some time).

### What is EC2 Hibernation

- The OS is told to perform hibernation (suspend-to-disk).
- Hibernation **saves the contents** from the instance memory (RAM) to your Amazon EBS root volume.
- We persist the instance's Amazon EBS root volume and any attached Amazon EBS data volumes.

### EC2 Hibernation in Action

- The **Amazon EBS** root volume is restored to its previous state.
- The **RAM** contents are reloaded.
- The processes that were previously running on the instance are resumed.
- Previously attached data volumes are **reattached and the instance retains its instance ID**.

![EC2 Hibernation](../images/ec2-hibernation.png)

- With EC2 hibernation, **the instance boots much faster**.
- The OS does not need to reboot because the in-memory state (RAM) is preserved.
- This is useful for:
  - Long-running processes.
  - Services that take time to initialize.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
**EC2 hibernation** preserves the in-memory RAM on persistent storage (EBS).

**Much faster to boot up** because you **do not need to reload the OS**.

**Instance RAM** must be less than **150 GB**.

**Instance families include instances in** General Purpose, Compute, Memory, and Storage Optimized groups.

**Available for** Windows, Amazon Linux 2 AMI, and Ubuntu.

**Instances can't be hibernated** for more than **60 days**.

**Max I/O**  
Used for big data, media, processing, etc.

### Storage Tiers

EFS comes with storage tiers and lifecycle management, allowing you to move your data from one tier to another after X number of days.

**Standard**  
For frequently accessed files.

**Infrequently Accessed**  
For file not frequently accessed.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
Supports the Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) protocol.

Only pay for the storage you use (no pre-provisioning required).

Can scale up to petabytes.

Can support thousands of concurrent NFS connections.

Data is stored across multiple AZs within a region.

Read-after-write consistency.

**If you have a scenario-based question around highly scalable shared storage using NFS, think EFS.**

## Amazon Machine Images: EBS vs Instance Store

### What is an AMI

An Amazon Machine Image provides the information required to launch an instance.

<Note>You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance.</Note>

### 5 Things You Can Base Your AMI On

- Region
- OS
- Architecture (32-bit or 64-bit)
- Launch permissions
- Storage for the root device (root device volume)

### EBS vs Instance Store

**Amazon EBS**  
The root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an Amazon EBS volume created from an Amazon EBS snapshot.

**Instance Store**  
The root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an instance store volume created from a template stored in Amazon S3.

### Instance Store Volumes

<Tip>
  Instance store volumes are sometimes called ephemeral storage. Instance store
  volumes **cannot be stopped**. If the underlying host fails, you will lose
  your data. You can, however, reboot the instance without losing your data. If
  you delete the instance, you will lose the instance store volume.
</Tip>

### EBS Volumes

<Tip>
EBS-backed instances **can be stopped**. You will not lose data on this instance if it is stopped. You can also reboot an EBS volume and not lose your data. By default, the root device volume will be deleted on termination. However, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume with EBS volumes.

</Tip>

### Exam Tips

<Note>
Instance store volumes are sometimes called ephemeral storage.

Instance store volumes **cannot be stopped**. If the underlying host fails, you lose your data.

EBS-backed instances **can be stopped**. You will not lose the data on the instance if it is stopped.

You can reboot both EBS and instance store volumes and you will not lose your data.

By default, both root volumes will be deleted on termination. However, with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume.

</Note>

<Tip>An AMI is just a blueprint for an EC2 instance.</Tip>
