## Availability Zones and Regions

### AWS Global Infrastructure

![AWS Global Infrastructure](../images/aws-global-infrastructure.png)

### Availability Zones

Think of an Availability Zone as a **Data Center**.

### Data Centers

A data center is just a building filled with **servers**.

An Availability Zone may be several data centers, but because they are close together, they are counted as **1 Availability Zone**.

### Regions

A geographical area. Each Region consists of **2 (or more) Availability Zones**.

<Note>
  **Upate:** AWS now defines Regions as **3 or more Availability Zones**.
</Note>

### Edge Locations

Endpoints for AWS that are used for caching content.

- Typically, this consists of **CloudFront**, Amazon's Content Delivery Network (CDN).
- There are **many more edge locations** that Regions.
- Currently, there are **over 215 edge locations**.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
**A Region** is a physical location in the world that consists of 2 or more Availability Zones (AZs).

**An AZ** is 1 or more discrete data centers - each with redundant power, networking, and connectivity - housed in separate facilities.

**Edge Locations** are endpoints for AWS that are used for caching content.

</Note>

## Shared Responsibility Model

### Renting Resources in the Cloud

Who's responsible for what?

| You              | Rental Company   |
| :--------------- | :--------------- |
| Not to damage it | Tire pressure    |
| Not to speed     | Full tank of gas |
| Pay tolls, etc   | Mechanics        |

### The Model

| Customer: Responsiblity for Security IN the Cloud            | AWS: Responsibility for Security OF the Cloud |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Customer Data                                                | Software                                      |
| Platform, Applications, Identitiy & Access Management        | Compute, Storage, Database, Networking        |
| Operating System, Network & Firewall Configuration           | Hardware/AWS Global Infrastructure            |
| Client-Side Data Encryption & Data Integrity Authentication  | Regions                                       |
| Server-Side Encryption (File System and/or Data)             | Availability Zones                            |
| Network Traffic Protection (Encryption, Integrity, Identity) | Edge Locations                                |

### Exam Tips

<Note>
**Can you do this yourself in the AWS Managemenet Console?**

**If yes, you are likely responsible.** Security groups, IAM users, patching EC2 operating systems, patching databases running on EC2, etc.

**If not, AWS is likely responsible.** Management of data centers, security cameras, cabling, patching RDS operating systems, etc.

**Encryption is a shared responsiblity.**

</Note>

## Compute, Storage, Databases, and Networking

### Compute

You wouldn't be able to build an application without compute power - you need something crunching the data.

- EC2
- Lambda
- Elastic Beanstalk

### Storage

Like a giant disk in the cloud - it's a safe place to save your information.

- S3
- EBS
- EFS
- FSx
- Storage Gateway

### Databases

Like a spreadsheet - a reliable way to store and retrieve information.

- RDS
- DynamoDB
- Redshift

### Networking

A way for compute, storage, and databases to communicate and to live.

- VPCs
- Direct Connect
- Route 53
- API Gateway
- AWS Global Accelerator

### Exam Tips

<Note>
**Compute:** EC2, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk.

**Storage:** S3, EBS, EFS, FSx, Storage Gateway.

**Databases:** RDS, DynamoDB, Redshift.

**Networking:** VPCs, Direct Connect, Route 53, API Gateway, AWS Global Accelerator.

</Note>

## The Well-Architected Framework

### AWS Whitepapers

AWS has hundreds of whitepapers available - `https://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers`.

### The 6 Pillars

**Operational Excellence**

Running and monitoring systems to deliver business value, and continually improving processes and procedures.

**Performance Efficiency**

Using IT computing resources efficiently.

**Security**

Protecting information and systems.

**Cost Optimization**

Avoiding unnecessary costs.

**Reliability**

Ensuring a workload performs its intended function correctly and consistently when it's expected.

**Sustainability**

Minimizing the environmental impacts of running cloud workloads.

### Exam Tips

<Note>**Read the Whitepaper.**</Note>

## Quiz: Availability Zones and Regions

<Note>
**Which statement best describes an Availability Zone?**

One or more discrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region.

**Why is security one of the pillars of the Well-Architected Framework?**

Because security is the highest priority at AWS; if you don't have a securely built application, your customers won't trust you with their data.

**Which of the following is NOT an AWS storage service?**

EC2

**Which one of the following items are NOT managed by AWS according to the shared responsibility model?**

Customer data.

**What category would the VPC service fall into?**

Networking.

# Chapter 3 - Identity and Access Management

- [Securing the Root Account](#securing-the-root-account)
- [IAM Policy Documents](#iam-policy-documents)
- [Permanent IAM Credentials](#permanent-iam-credentials)
- [Quiz: Identity and Access Management](#quiz-identity-and-access-management)

## Securing the Root Account

### What is IAM

Allows you to manage users and their level of access to the AWS console.

- Create users and grant permissions to them.
- Create groups and roles.
- Control access to AWS resources.

### What is the Root Account

The `root account` is the email address you used to sign up for AWS. It has full administrative access to AWS. It is important to secure this account.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
Enable multi-factor authentication on the root account.

Create an admin group for your administrators, and assign the appropriate permissions to this group.

Create user accounts for your administrators.

Add your users to the admin group.

</Note>

## IAM Policy Documents

### Permissions with IAM

We assign permissions using policy documents, which are made up of JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).

### JSON Example of Policy Documents

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "*",
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Permanent IAM Credentials

### The Building Blocks of IAM

- **Users** - a physical person.
- **Groups** - Functions, such as administrator, developer, etc. Contains users.
- **Roles** - Internal usage within AWS.

### Best Practices: Policies

<Tip>It's best practice for users to **inherit permissions** from groups.</Tip>

### Best Practices: Users and People

Always work on the principle that one users **equals** one physical person. Never share user accounts across multiple people.

### The Principle of Least Privilege

Only assign a user the **minimum** amount of privileges they need to do their job.

<Tip>Some AWS policies are a **Job function** type.</Tip>

### Identity Providers

Allow you to connect IAM to external identity providers like **Azure AD**, under **IAM** > **Access management** > **Identity providers**.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
**IAM is universal:** It does not apply to regions at this time.

**The Root Account:** The account created when you first set up your AWS account and which has complete admin access. Secure it as soon as possible and **do not** use it to log in day to day.

**New Users:** No permissions when first created.

**Access key ID and secret access keys are not the same as usernames and passwords.**

**You only get to view these once.** If you lose them, you have to regenerate them. So, save them in a secure location.

**Always setup password rotations.** You can create and customize your own password rotation policies.

**IAM Federation:** You can combine your existing user account with AWS. For example, when you log on to your PC (usually using Microsoft Active Directory), you can use the same credentials to log in to AWS if you set up federation.

**Identity Federation in Azure:** Uses the `SAML` standard through Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), which enables seamless and secure authentication across various systems, allowing users to access multiple apps with a single set of credentials.

</Note>

## S3 Overview

### What Is S3

- **Object Storage** - provides secure, durable, highly scalable object storage.
- **Scalable** - store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web at a very low cost.
- **Simple** - easy to use, with a simple web service interface.

**Object-based Storage**

Manages data as objects rather than in file systems or data blocks.

- **Upload any file type** you can think of to S3.
- **Examples** include photos, videos, code, documents, and text files.
- **Cannot** be used to run an operating system or database.

### S3 Basics

- **Unlimited Storage** - the total volume of data and the number of objects you can store is unlimited.
- **Objects up to 5 TB in Size** - S3 objects can range in size from a minimum of 0 bytes to a maximum of 5 TB.
- **S3 Buckets** - store files in buckets (similar to folders).

### Working with S3 Buckets

- **Universal Namespace** - all AWS accounts share the S3 namespace. Each S3 bucket name is globally unique.
- **Example S3 URLs** - `https://bucket-name.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key-name.
- **Uploading Files** - when you upload a file to an S3 bucket, you will receive an HTTP 200 code if the upload was successful.

### Key-Value Store

- **Key** - the name of the object.
- **Value** - the data itself, which is made up of a sequence of bytes.
- **Version ID** - important for storing multiple versions of the same object.
- **Metadata** - data about the data you are storing (e.g. `content-type`, `last-modified`, etc).

### Availability & Durability

The data is spread across multiple devices and facilities to **ensure availability** and **durability**.

- **Built for Availability** - built for 99.95% - 99.99% **service availability**, depending on the S3 tier.
- **Designed for Durability** - designed for 99.999999999% (9 decimal places) durability for **data stored** in S3.
- Suitable for most workloads.
  - The default storage class.
  - Use cases include website, content distribution. mobile and gaming apps, and big data analytics.

### Characteristics

- **Tiered Storage** - S3 offers a range of storage classes designed for different use cases.
- **Lifecycle Management** - define rules to automatically transition objects to a cheaper storage tier or delete objects that are no longer required after a set period of time.
- **Versioning** - with versioning, all versions of an object are stored and can be rertieved, including deleted objects.

### Securing your Data

- **Server-Side Encryption** - you can set default encryption on a bucket to encrypt all new objects whe they are stored in the bucket.
- **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** - define which AWS accounts or groups are granted access and the type of access. You can attach S3 ACLs to individual objects within a bucket.
- **Bucket Policies** - S3 bucket policies specify what actions are allowed or denied.

### Consistency Model

**Strong Read-After-Write Consistency**

- **After a successful write** of a new object (`PUT`) or an overwrite of an existing object, any subsequent read request immediately receives the latest version of the object.
- **Strong consistency** for list operations, so after a write, you can immediately perform a listing of the objects in a bucket with all the changes reflected.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
**Object Based** - object based-storage allows you to upload files.

**Files up to 5 TB** - files can from 0 bytes to 5 TB.

**Not OS or DB Storag** - not suitable to install an operating system or run a database on.

**Unlimited Storage** - the total volume of data and the number of objects you can store is unlimited.

S3 is a universal namespace.

Successful CLI or API uploads will generate an **HTTP 200 status code**.

**Key** - the object name.

**Value** - the data itself, which is made up of a sequence of bytes.

**Version ID** - allows you to store multiple versions of the same object.

**Metadata** - data about the data you are storing.

</Note>

## Securing your Bucket with S3 Block Public Access

### Object ACLs vs Bucket Policies

- **Object ACLs** - work on an **individual object** level.
- **Bucket Policies** - work on an **entire bucket** level.

### Exam Tips

<Note>
**Buckets are private by default:** when you create an S3 bucket, it is private by default (including all objects within it). You have to allow public access on both the **bucket** and its **objects** in order to make the bucket public.

**Object ACLs:** you can make **individual objects** public using object ACLs.

**Bucket policies:** you can make **entire buckets** public using bucket policies.

**HTTP status code:** when you upload an object to S3 and it's successful, you will receive an **HTTP 200** code.

</Note>

## Hosting a Static Website

### Static Websites on S3

You can use S3 to host static websites, such as `.html` sites.

- **Dynamic websites**, such as those that require **database connections**, cannot be hosted on S3.

### Automatic Scaling

**S3 scales automatically to meet demand.**

- Many enterprises will put static websites on S3 when they think there is going to be a large number of requests (e.g. for a movie preview).

### Hosting a Static Website

**Enable Static Website Hosting**

- On a **Bucket**, select **Properties**.
- Select `Edit` on **Static website hosting**.
- Toggle `Enable`.
- Toggle `Host a static website`.
- Under **Index document**, enter the home page of the site - `index.html`
- Under **Error document (optional)**, enter the error page of the site - `error.html`.
- Select `Save changes`.

**Upload Site Files**

- On the **Bucket**, select **Objects**.
- Select **Upload**.
- Select **Add files**.

**Enable Public Access**

- On the **Bucket**, select **Permissions**.
- Under **Bucket Policy**, select **Edit**.
- Paste in the policy `json` code.

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": "*",
      "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource": ["arn:aws::s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Exam Tips

<Note>
**Bucket Policies:** make entire buckets public using bucket policies.

**Static Content:** use S3 to host static content only (not dynamic).

**Automatic Scaling:** S3 scales automatically with demand.

</Note>

## Versioning Objects in S3

### What is Versioning

You can enable versioning in S3 so you can have **multiple versions of an object within S3**.

- **All Versions** - all versions of an object are stored in S3. This includes all writes and even if you delete an object.
- **Backup** - can be a great backup tool.
- **Cannot Be Deleted** - once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled - only suspended.
- **Lifecycle Rules** - can be integrated with lifecycle rules.
- **Supports MFA** - can support multi-factor authentication.

<Note>Previous versions of an object are **not publicly accessible**.</Note>

### Exam Tips

<Note>
**All versions:** all versions of an object are stored in S3. This includes all writes and even if you delete an object.

**Backup:** can be a great backup tool.

**Cannot be Disabled:** once enabled, versioning cannot be disabled - only suspended.

**Lifecycle Rules:** can be integrated with lifecycle rules.

**Suports MFA:** can support multi-factor authentication.

</Note>

## S3 Storage Classes

### S3 Standard

- **High Availability & Durability** - data is stored redundantly across multiple devices in multiple facilities (>=3 AZs):

  - 99.99% availability.
  - 99.999999999% durability (11 9's).

- **Designed for Frequent Access** - perfect for frequently accessed data.
- **Suitable for Most Workloads**
  - The default storage class.
  - Use cases include websites, content distribution, mobile and gaming apps, and big data analytics.

### S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA)

- **Rapid Access** - used for data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed.
- **You Pay to Access the Data** - There is a low per-GB storage price and per-GB retrieval fee.
- **Use Cases** - great for long-term storage, backups, and as a data store for disaster recovery files.

### S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access

Like S3 Standard-IA, but data is stored redundantly within a single AZ.

- Costs **20% less** than regular S3 Standard-IA.
- Great for long-lived, infrequently accessed, non-critical data.
- 99.5% Availability.
- 99.999999999% Durability.

### S3 Intelligent Tiering

**Frequent & Infrequent Access**  
Automatically moves your data to the most cost-effective tier based on how frequently you access each object.

**Optimizes Cost**  
Monthly fee of $0.0025 per 1000 objects.

### 3 Glacier Options

- You pay each time you access your data.
- Use only for archiving data.
- Glacier is cheap storage.
- Optimized for data that is infrequently accessed.

**Option 1 - Glacier Instant Retrieval**  
Provides **long-term data archiving** with instant retrieval time for your data.

**Option 2 - Glacier Flexible Retrieval**  
Ideal storage class for archive data that does not require immediate access but needs the flexibility to retrieve large sets of data at no cost, such as backup or disaster recovery use cases. Can be minutes or up to 12 hours.

**Option 3 - Glacier Deep Archive**  
Cheapest storage class and designed for customers that retain data sets for 7-10 years or longer to meet customer needs and regulatory compliance requirements. The standard retrieval time is 12 hours, and the bulk retrieval time is 48 hours.
